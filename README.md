# Free Image Checker - Desktop App
The Free Image Checker Desktop App is a user-friendly solution designed to simplify the process of finding and downloading high-quality images from popular sources. This project connects to the Unsplash and Pixabay APIs to retrieve data and provides users with the ability to search for photos using keywords. The user-friendly interface and fast retrieval time make the process of downloading photos simple and efficient.

To ensure seamless functionality, the observer pattern was applied to the system. The search and download objects act as observers and are notified of any changes made by the subject, or Unsplash/Pixabay object, through the setState and getState methods. This allows the observer to receive the new state and update the current state of the system.

Throughout the project, the team collaborated effectively and learned various important skills, including team collaboration, fulfilling individual roles, and prioritizing work. However, there were also areas for improvement, such as the implementation of a database to store images and accompanying information for future reference.

The project was a successful learning experience, providing the team with valuable insights into software development, project management, and teamwork. The concepts learned will benefit the team in future classes, projects, and careers.
